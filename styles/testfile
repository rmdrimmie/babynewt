I think sometimes it surprises people when I talk about God, and what I think God is, and what I think God's like, and what I think God's reason is.

Actually, I don't think people know that about me, that I think about what God's like, because I don't often express my thoughts about my god is a personal sense.

Why?  Well, here's the rub.  I feel uncomfortable saying "my god" because I don't actually believe in my god.  It's my impression of what God is, if God does exist.

But that's part of what it means to be Agnostic, which is something that people who aren't agnostic just don't get.  On the one hand, there's absolutely nothing out there that convinces me that God exists, but on the other, well, there's nothing that convinces me that God <em>doesn't</em> exist, either.

I mean, sure, some of the answers sometime seem hokey, but <em>fuck</em>, I mean it's <em>God</em>.  If God exists, and God's anything like any of the holy books say, then it's not a problem for God to plan out and build a fucking universe.  That's small change.  

Home Sapiens have been around for what?  A few million years or something?

Wait.  There's another sub-specification?  According to <a href="http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo2/modern_humans.htm">Evolution of Modern Humans: Early Modern Homo sapiens"</a> at a .edu named "Palomar" (I felt lucky on "homo sapiens evolved") <em>Home sapiens sapiens</em> showed up 100,000 years ago or so.

<a name="Ast1Main"></a>Anyway, so humans as we know us have been around for 100,000 years or so, that's jack squat.  Think about how much we know already about the Universe and the Way Things Work&trade;)<a href="#Ast1Foot">*</a>.  I mean, people like Stephen Hawking are saying we really do know a whole fuck of a lot about the way the universe works.  We get this shit, and we get it so well, we can explain it to the population at large.

That, uh, was something of a paraphrase.  It's not in <em>The Universe in a Nutshell</em>, it <em>is</em> The Universe in a Nutshell. So I guess I'm saying it, not Stephen Hawking.  I really shouldn't even be putting Stephen Hawking's name in here, because Stephen Hawking has absolutely nothing to do with this site, nor would he endorse it.

And, uh, I'm saying right now if Mr. Hawking ever asks me to take that down, I'd do it in a second, because holy fuck <i>Stephen Hawking</i> communicated with me.  I would avoid the medium (Cease and Desists, I'm sure) if possible, but I'll respect the man's wishes.

Uhm.  Where was I?

This is why I could never actually teach anyone anything, I get distra-

Oer!  Shiny thing!

Right, right.  This started with that whole my god thing.  Anyway, there's all this good argument for each side.  One says that everything doesn't make perfectly logical sense, 
but y'know, we can guess it really fucking well.

We can't predict storms perfectly -- and an aside I don't feel like getting into right now, would we want to? -- and we can't predict the velocity of a particle and the position of the particle at the same time, but it's chaos we're used to, because we've been dealing with it with storms and oceans and viruses and stock markets, and there's just no way of knowing that shit for 100% absolute certain.  

But then, 400 years ago no one could accurately predict how much phosphorus would result from the reduction of rine.<sup>1</sup>

To this day I just think that the one-click patent shouldn't have been awarded, and I show it throw a lame, occasionally announced boycott.  Maybe one day I'll be able to put an affiliate link up there and really sell out.
